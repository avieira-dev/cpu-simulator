# CPU SIMULATOR

A didactic CPU (Central Processing Unit) simulator written in C.  
This project aims to demonstrate how a basic processor works internally, including the fetch-decode-execute cycle, registers, memory management, and instruction decoding.

## Status

🚧 Under initial development.

The architecture is currently being defined and structured. Implementation of the CPU core will begin soon.
